# SOC - Society of Cybersecurity
The SOC club at the American University of Sharjah is the primary club for all things cybersecurity.
We provide students with opportunities to explore and enter the cybersecurity world, regardless of
their skill level and previous knowledge. We host events, talks, and competitions to help people get started.
